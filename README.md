Quick File Hasher is a modern Nautilus (GNOME Files) extension and standalone GTK4/libadwaita application for computing file hashes, featuring a polished UI and seamless clipboard integration.

## Features

- **Nautilus context menu integration**: Right-click files/folders and select "Quick File Hasher".
- **Modern GTK4/libadwaita UI**: Responsive, animated, and user-friendly interface.
- **Batch Processing**: Quickly calculate hashes for multiple files and folders in parallel.
- **Copy/Compare**: Copy results to clipboard or compare file hash with clipboard contents.
- **Progress bar & cancel**: See progress and cancel long jobs.
- **Drag & Drop**: Drop files/folders into the app. On the Checksum tab the drop overlay splits in two — drop a file on the left to compute its hash, or a checksum file on the right to compare.
- **Hash Text**: Hash arbitrary text strings with live preview — type or paste text, choose your algorithm and encoding, and see the hash update in real time (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>).
- **Job Statistics**: See elapsed time, throughput (MB/s), and file count after each hashing job completes.
- **CSV Export**: Save results as CSV in addition to plain text for easy import into spreadsheets.
- **VirusTotal Integration**: Check file hashes against VirusTotal's database for malware detection. Supports MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. Unknown files can be submitted for analysis with automatic polling for results.

## Installation

### System Dependencies

The app requires GTK4, libadwaita, and Python GObject bindings. Install the system packages for your distribution:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-nautilus libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev \
  gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 gir1.2-nautilus-4.0 \
  libgirepository1.0-dev libgirepository-2.0-dev libcairo2-dev pkg-config
```
```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S nautilus-python gtk4 libadwaita gobject-introspection cairo
```
```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install nautilus-python gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel \
  gobject-introspection-devel cairo-gobject-devel
```

### Python Dependencies

Install Python dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv sync
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install pycairo pygobject pygobject-stubs
```

### Application Install

1. **Copy the extension manually:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions
   cp quick-file-hasher-app.py ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/
   ```
2. **Or use the Makefile for easy install:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
3. **Restart Nautilus:**
   ```bash
   nautilus -q
   ```

## Usage

- **From Nautilus:**
  - Select files/folders, right-click, and select "Quick File Hasher".
- **From command-line:**
  - Run directly: `python3 quick-file-hasher-app.py [file1] [file2] [folder1] ...`
- **From overview:**
  - After running `make install`, a desktop shortcut will be created. You can then launch the app from your system application overview. (Press the Super key and search for "Quick File Hasher")
- **Drag-and-drop:**
  - Drag files/folders into the app window to compute their hashes.
  - In the Checksum tab, the drop overlay splits in two halves: drop a file on the left "Drop Files Here" half to compute its hash, or drop a checksum text file on the right "Drop Checksum File Here" half to load it for comparison.
- **Filter results:**
  - Click the search icon in the header bar or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to show the search bar. Filter results instantly as you type.
- **Multi-Hash:**
  - This feature enables selection of additional hashing algorithms for the given file.
- **Hash Text:**
  - Click "Hash Text" in the toolbar or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to open the text hashing dialog. Type or paste text, select an algorithm and encoding (UTF-8, ASCII, Latin-1), and see the hash update live as you type.
- **VirusTotal:**
  - Click the VirusTotal button on any file to check its hash against VirusTotal's database.
  - If the hash is found, you'll see detection stats (malicious/suspicious/harmless/undetected).
  - If the hash is not found, you can submit the file to VirusTotal for analysis.
  - Submitted files are automatically polled for results (every 15s for up to 10 attempts, ~2.5 minutes).
  - Requires a VirusTotal API key (free) configured in Preferences.

## Arguments

You can also run the app with additional command-line arguments for more control:

```
python3 quick-file-hasher-app.py [file1] [file2] ... [folder] [--recursive] [--gitignore] [--max-workers 4] [--algo sha256] [--virustotal]
```

- `--virustotal`: Automatically check hashes with VirusTotal after computing
- `--list-choices`: List available hash algorithms
- `--new-window`: Open in a new window

Type `--help` for more information.

## Preferences

The **Preferences** dialog allows you to customize the application's behavior.
- **Recursive Traversal**
  - Enable this to process files within subdirectories.
- **Respect `.gitignore`**
  - When enabled, files and folders listed in the `.gitignore` file will be skipped.
- **Max Workers**
  - Sets the maximum number of parallel hashing operations. Adjust this value to optimize performance based on your systems capabilities.
- **Hashing Algorithm**
  - Select the default hashing algorithm from the list.
  - Available options include (hashlib): `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, `blake2b`, `blake2s` and more. The default is `sha256`.
- **Output Style**
  - Select the output format for checksum display.
  - Available options are the app's default style, sha256sum, and BSD.
- **VirusTotal API Key**
  - Enter your VirusTotal API key to enable hash lookups and file submissions.
  - Get a free API key at [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com).
  - The key is stored locally in the app's config file.

#### **Note:** Changes to these settings are only saved across sessions when the `Persist` button is clicked. Additionally, command-line arguments can override these preferences at startup.

## CI

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. On every pull request and push to `main`, the CI pipeline:

- Verifies syntax with `py_compile`
- Tests that the app loads correctly (`--help`, `--list-choices`)
- Runs a functional test that launches the app and hashes a file
- Tests against Python 3.12 and 3.13
